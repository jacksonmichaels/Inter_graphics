// ****TO-DO: 
// My Note: Copy origonal phong, take the whole thing, and replace any avarying inputs we recieved from previous vertex shader with a texture sample
//	0) copy original forward Phong shader
//	1) declare g-buffer textures as uniform samplers
//	2) declare light data as block
//	3) replace geometric information normally received from fragment shader 
//		with samples from respective g-buffer textures; use to compute lighting
//			-> position calculated using reverse perspective divide; requires 
//				inverse projection-bias matrix and the depth map
//			-> normal calculated by expanding range of normal sample
//			-> surface texture coordinate is used as-is once sampled
