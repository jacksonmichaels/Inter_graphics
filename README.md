Black Hole fragment shader implementation

Vertex Shader implementation and integration with fragment shader

Refactored fragment shader for increased readability
## Description
This project uses fragment and vertex shaders to simulate the light warping effects observed neaby a black hole. The basic effect is to take the fragments that are close to the center of the black hole and shift them outwards to make the illusion that light from objects behind the Black Hole is being bent around the edges to the observers eye.
